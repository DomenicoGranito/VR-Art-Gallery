<h1>What is VR-Art-Gallery?</h1>
<p>
VR-Art-Gallery is a full stack, mobile-responsive, virtual reality application built in React and deployed in Preact where users can upload images into their own custom art galleries to display to the world. As a user, you customize your two-story gallery with texture presets for the floors and walls, and choose your own gallery music (all songs were performed by <a href="http://freemusicarchive.org/music/Kevin_MacLeod/">Kevin Macleod</a>).  Additionally, you can favorite other galleries, share their links, or create private galleries that are only accessible by the link you provide.
</p>

<h1>Technologies</h1>
  <h2> Virtual Reality Techs:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>A-Frame</li>
    <li>aframe-extras</li>
    <li>aframe-physics-system</li>
    <li>aframe-react</li>
    <li>aframe-room-component</li>
    <li>aframe-star-system-component</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
  The foundation for the 3D environment was built in A-frame with aframe-react serving as a proxy between the aframe framework and react library.  The aframe-physics-system, as well as aframe-extras, were implemented for collision detection between the user and entities in addition to providing a gravitational force for when the user drops down from the 2nd floor to the first.  The aframe-room-component was used to build the 2D dimensional planes for the first-floor and walls of the gallery, which also allowed for the repetition of repeating textures for a more realistic, and less stretched, appearance of the user-selected presets.  The aframe-star-system-component provides the spherical backdrop and populates it with star-like particles. All entities within this application were either imported 3D models, entirely free and under the royalty free license from turboSquid, imported repeating-texture files, or built with aframe.registerComponent (Clock).

  <h2>Amazon S3 Relevant Techs:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>attr-accept</li>
    <li>aws-sdk</li>
    <li>uuid</li>
    <li>react-dropzone</li>
  </ul>
  
  <img src="./readmeFiles/dropzone.gif" alt="Dropzone in creating a gallery">
  
  <p>
    Users are able to add images to their gallery thumbnails, as well as populate their gallery, using the react-dropzone on the client-side in combination with aws-sdk in the server - setting up a connection between the client and amazon S3 bucket.  Those images, presets, and captions are then retrieved using the techs listed below.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Client to Backend Techs:</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>bcryptjs</li>
    <li>axios</li>
    <li>dotenv</li>
    <li>massive</li>
    </ul>

  <div>
  <img src="./readmeFiles/register.gif" alt="Register view">
  <p>Bcryptjs was used for salting and hashing user-created passwords for securely registered accounts, and all sensitive keys, passwords, and related information is stored in dotenv.</p>
  </div>
  <p>Axios was used for making client to server-side calls, and massive was used for connecting my server-side to the database.</p>
  <h2>Core Application Techs:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>preact</li>
    <li>preact-compat</li>
    <li>prop-types</li>
    <li>react</li>
    <li>react-dom</li>
    <li>react-redux</li>
    <li>react-router-dom</li>
    <li>react-scripts</li>
    <li>redux</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  As mentioned in the opening description, this application was built in react and therefore contains all of the same scripts as a react app; however, the deployed application is in preact using preact-compat alias in the package-json.  React-router-dom is used for redirected users from landing-page to lobby as well as anyone's gallery by taking in the author and gallery name as params.  Redux was implemented as a solution to a run-time error in passing image URLs in the mounting of the ArtGallery component to the assets file which contains the portrait entities populating the gallery.

<h1>Stylistic Features</h1>

    <li>Pagination</li>
    <li>Notifications (Favorites‚ù§Ô∏è, Sharingü§ù)</li>
  </ul>

<h1>Functional Features</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Search Filters</li>
    <li>Portal Hopping</li>
    <li>Gallery Jamsüéµ</li>
  </ul>

  <img src="./readmeFiles/stereo.gif" alt="3D stereo" width="100%">

  <p>
  A-Frame has a built in link entity that functions identically to an anchor tag and allows users to traverse from a-scene (3D environment) to a-scene; however, we found this incompatible within the react library, specifically with react-router-dom, and we re-created the shader and portal entity without the link functionality and simply redirected the user programtically with react-router's history.  The user simply has to left-click entities in order to interact with them: Stereo, Exit Door (redirects to landing page), and Portal.
  </p>
  
<h1>Performance Issues</h1>
<p>
  Make sure that "Hardware Acceleration" is enabled if you are using Google Chrome. You can enable this setting by doing the following:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>Click the 3 circles in the top right corner of the window</li>
  <li>Click on settings</li>
  <li>Scroll down and click on advanced</li>
  <li>Enable "Use hardware acceleration when available"</li>
  <li>Click on the "Relaunch" button that appears</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  This application has been tested for performance in Edge, Firefox, and Chrome.

<h1>Stretch Goals</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Make Gallery multi-network and supports audio chat.</li>
    <li>Notifications tab so users can get statistics on views, favorites, shares, and who is looking at their galleries specifically.</li>
    <li>Built in Messages tab so users can message one another within Lobby/Landing Page - ostensibly in 3D Gallery as well.</li>
    <li>Expand presets so that users are not limited to built-in application presets.</li>
  </ul>
